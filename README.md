## Questions 

### Question 1 
Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and number of times it has been rented out.

### Question 2
Provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final quarter) based on the quartiles
( 25%,50%,75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories

### Question 3
Provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category

### Question 4 
We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data
for. Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month. Your table should include a column for each of the following: year, month, store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that month.
